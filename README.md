# LOG8415 : Queue Analysis

Repository of my personnal project in the **LOG8415 : Advanced Concepts of Cloud Computing** class at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

## Queue analysis (*Analyse de files d'attentes*)

The project's main goal is to get hands on with AWS services like **Lambda functions**, **Simple Queue Service** and **Simple Storage Service**  in order to complete a performance analysis of actual implementation of waiting queues using a serverless approach.
